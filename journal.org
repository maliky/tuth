* <2025-11-10 Mon 04:35>  Updated implementation plan
** Curriculum creation & approval
 - Keep using Django admin/import-export for deans to create curricula + prerequisites (already works).
 - Wire the existing ApprovalQueue to the admin save hook so any curriculum marked “pending” automatically creates a queue item for VPAA review, and add a simple admin action (“Approve via VPAA”) that flips status + closes the queue entry. No new UI needed beyond admin extensions.
# > For this I am cautious about adding queue item for VPAA.  I think it introduce complexity.  It would be better to simply use exiting state tracking classes and expose that field as editable to the VPAA when he list the curriculum.  I think there's already a bool actualy doing that job of flagging the curriculum as validated or pending. Why didn't you like that simple option ?

** Enrollment officer workflow
- Continue letting enrollment staff create student profiles directly in admin.To support document uploads, expose the registry.DocumentStudent inline and add an admin filter showing “missing required docs” so officers can confirm completeness before flipping a student to “eligible.” (No separate front-end yet.)
# > That's ok you can make the change for that

** Student pre-registration (what’s still missing)
- Data: need at least one active semester with sections, plus RegistrationStatus entries (pending, cleared, etc.)—once seeded, the current views can render.
# > Sections are there. What is missing are registrationstatus entries. Can you mock them up ?
- Functionality: implement POST handlers on /courses/ to:
# > are you sure this should be on courses and not on reservation ?  
  - enforce seat counts (Section.current_registrations updates)
  - attach a Registration.status = pending
# > Do not mixe Course and CurriculumCourse, Sections and SecSession.  seat counts is linked to Section not Course
# > What we will need to add in the future is the possibility for a Dean a associated facutlies with courses they can potentialy teach.
    
  - block courses where prerequisites or schedule conflicts fail (validation logic largely exists but must be applied server-side).
# > The scheduling checks should not be done now. For creating the schedule I will use an external application  such ad FET. But it is true that my app should check on input for time, room, faculty, or student conflicts although this should have been done in creating the schedule for the different sessions.
# > What can happen since we give the choice to student of different SecSession is that they selected conflicting session. This should be flagged at reservation level.

  - Add a “Reservations” list and cancel action so students can withdraw before finance clears them.
# > This is already implemented in the cards of the student UX. Why do you propose it again ?
  - Hook status changes into StatusHistory so we can audit transitions.
# > Which status changes are you talking about?  We do not need to audit change to the status tables
** Financial clearance
- Build a minimal finance UI (or admin action) that lists Registration rows with status = pending and lets a finance officer trigger “clear” (set status to cleared, maybe attach DocumentPayment for proof).
# > you can impmelent this. The attachement of a payment proof is important but not mandatory.  We can trust the finance officer that he file the proof outside of the system.  
- Tie receipts/payments to Invoice and expose a button “Mark cleared” that simply changes the registration status; this is low-cost because the backend already has models.
# > This should be very similare to an admin table listing invoices with and editable boolean field 'payment cleared'. 
** Registrar validation
- Per your note, defer new registrar features for now. Once the earlier steps
are stable, we can revisit the registrar dashboard to add actions that convert
cleared registrations into official roster entries.
# > yes. confirmed. defer for now.


* DONE The scenario narrative is solid, but “ready to run” depends on whether each step already has backing data, permissions, and UI hooks in the codebase:
  CLOSED: [2025-11-10 Mon 05:19]

  - Dean → VPAA workflow: 
# > But for me the Dean can create a curriculum using the admin interface and event import a curriculum and prerequisits using the import-export extention.

  - Enrollment officer & student onboarding: 
# >  the way I see that above is the enrollement staff creating the student profil using the admin interface directly.

  - Student pre-registration:
# > Ok so except data, what is missing here concretely to make it work ?
    
  - Financial clearance: 
# > Well we can do that right ? it does not cost much doesn't it ?

  - Registrar validation: 
# > lets hold on this one for now.

* Tusis Web Design Guide
** Overview
*** Legacy Critique & Modernization
 The legacy TU marketing pages deliver a bold identity yet ship heavy DOM trees, large hero imagery, and overlapping JS plugins. On low bandwidth this causes late first paint, layout shift, and inaccessible interactions (multi-level hover menus without keyboard support, insufficient focus states, low-contrast hover colors). The situation is amplified because most visitors arrive on smartphones with modest CPUs and limited data packages. This guide keeps the recognizable palette and component vocabulary but reworks each element to be accessible-first, mobile-first, performant on slow networks, and easier to maintain inside Tusis.
*** Purpose
 This guide distills the visual language used across the public Tubman University pages that power Tusis. Use it to ensure every new screen inherits the same character: bold institutional branding, information-dense layouts, and mobile-ready behaviors.

*** Audience
 - Designers translating wireframes into high-fidelity comps
 - Frontend engineers implementing templates in Django/Bootstrap
 - Content editors evaluating whether a new block matches the system

*** Source Material
 Patterns documented here are reverse-engineered from the live TU marketing pages (top header, mega navigation, hero carousel, Swiper-driven news slider, card grids, tabular directory, contact map, and footer).

** Design Pillars
 1. *Heritage First* – foreground TU’s deep green (#134529) and phoenix gold (#ffc107) while preserving WCAG AA contrast and legible hover states.
 2. *Mobile First Access* – design layouts, breakpoints, and assets so the smartphone experience (portrait ≤576 px) is primary; scale up gracefully to tablets/desktops.
 3. *Information Density With Order* – welcome long tables and narratives but enforce consistent spacing, progressive disclosure, and typographic rhythm to reduce cognitive load.
 4. *Motion With Restraint* – limit animation to meaningful cues (carousels, Swiper, counters, scrollCue) and respect =prefers-reduced-motion=.
 5. *Device Parity* – ensure the off-canvas mobile experience exposes identical navigation depth as desktop mega menus.
 6. *Bandwidth Respect* – keep critical CSS/JS under 200 KB compressed, lazy-load media, and defer optional libraries until needed.
 7. *Accessibility First* – semantic HTML, keyboard focus rings, ARIA labeling, and skip links are mandatory.

** Brand Tokens
*** Logo Usage                                                       :ATTACH:

    :ID:       73aff189-9eb4-4a1d-9f61-f435d629c007
    :END:
 - Default lockup: use the redesigned TU crest stored with this guide (=ID=73aff189…=). Provide SVG + PNG (512 px square) variants to ensure crisp scaling.
 - Size limits: header max-height =64px= on desktop (=56px= tablet), responsive drawer icon =100px= square, footer lockup =80px=.
 - Maintain ≥16px clear space on all sides and avoid drop shadows or background panels.

*** Color Palette
 | Role                     | Hex      | Usage                                                                 |
 |--------------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Primary Evergreen        | #134529  | Header backgrounds, CTA icons, counters, carousel controls            |
 | Phoenix Gold Accent      | #ffc107  | Footer background, hover states, badges, CTA underline on hover       |
 | Alert Crimson            | #cc0000  | “TU Portals” button, destructive emphasis                             |
 | Warm Neutral 100         | #f8f9fa  | Section backgrounds, card fill                                        |
 | Cool Gray 400            | #ced4da  | Borders for tables, cards, PDF embed frames                           |
 | Rich Black               | #000000  | Carousel captions, nav text on white backgrounds                      |
 | Pure White               | #ffffff  | Topography contrast, cards, copy blocks                               |

** Typography
*** Font Stack
 Use highly readable humanist sans fonts to support audiences less accustomed to long-form reading:
 =Inter, "Source Sans 3", "Segoe UI", system-ui, -apple-system, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif=.
 Serve Inter via self-hosted files or Google Fonts with =font-display: swap= to keep text visible on slow networks. Enable font-smoothing for dense tables.

*** Hierarchy
 - H1/Hero: 48–64px on desktop, 32px on tablet; heavy weight 700.
 - H2 section headings: 32px/1.2 line-height, centered for hero sections, left-aligned elsewhere.
 - H3/H4: 18–22px for card titles and micro labels.
 - Body copy: 16px with 1.6 line-height for readability within long paragraphs (see President’s message).
 - Utility text (top bar, timestamps): 12px uppercase/medium.

*** Text Treatments
   
 - Use =text-transform: uppercase= sparingly (top ribbon labels, mission/vision headings).
 - Justify long-form narratives; keep cards, lists, and nav items left-aligned.
 - Use bold/strong for names and job titles in directories, not colors.

** Layout & Spacing
*** Grid & Containers
 - Global container: =.container-fluid= for full-width stripes; nest =.container= to center 1200px content.
 - Section padding: =padding: 60px 0= standard; hero/counters use 75px bottom padding.
 - Column layout: rely on Bootstrap’s 12-column grid (e.g., =col-lg-6= for split hero, =col-xl-6= for events list).

*** Spacing Rules
 - Vertical rhythm: 30px between stacked headings and text blocks.
 - Card padding: 15px internal padding, 8px radius, =box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)=.
 - Funfact counters: zero gutter rows (=row g-0=) to create seamless tiles.

** Navigational Components
*** Top Header Ribbon
 - Background: #134529 with 10px vertical padding.
 - Layout: three columns (logo, “Rising Phoenix” links, portals dropdown).
 - Micro copy uses 10–12px uppercase text with 350 weight; links remain white with underline on hover.
 - TU Portals dropdown: red button with absolute dropdown panel (min-width 160px) and =z-index:20=.

*** Primary Navbar
 - Use Bootstrap =navbar-expand-lg= with =justify-content-center=.
 - Dropdown depth: allow multi-level menus (up to two nested =.dropdown-menu=). Provide hover underline (#ffc107) and keep text dark (#000) on white.
 - Mobile: reuse off-canvas component (#navbarOffcanvas) with evergreen background, accordion-style nested lists, close icon from RemixIcon.

** Hero & Media
*** Carousel
 - Implement Bootstrap carousel (#carouselExampleControls) with 3 slides.
 - Imagery: 70vh height, =object-fit: cover=.
 - Captions: overlay with semi-transparent black (#00000080), 10px padding, 10px radius.
 - Controls: default icons with white fill; set =.carousel-control-prev/next= to show on hover for desktop, always visible on mobile.

*** Video/PDF Embeds
 - Use the =pdf-container= helper (56.25% padding-bottom) for responsive embeds.
 - Keep border radius 0 and hide overflow.

** Content Blocks
*** About Section
 - Two-column layout with image left, copy right for desktop; stack on mobile.
 - Include title block (small uppercase label + main heading) and justify paragraphs.
 - “Read More” arrow CTA uses =.arrow-btn= with icon from Flaticon.

*** Mission/Funfact Tiles
 - Three columns, alternating brand backgrounds (#134529) and white.
 - Flex center icons + text; each tile uses unified padding (30px) and =i= icons from Flaticon.

*** Upcoming Events / Announcements
 - Left column: event highlight with background fill (#134529) and countdown digits (big-text, uppercase labels).
 - Right column: stacked =.upcoming-content-info= rows containing image (96x96), status badge (“Ended”), title link, metadata list (date + location).
 - Countdown logic: vanilla JS interval decreasing =totalSeconds=.

*** Counters
 - Four columns using =.single-counter-info d-flex=.
 - Icons left, numeric value right; use data attributes or =.counter= class for JS increment.

*** Swiper “Latest News”
 - Initialize Swiper with =slidesPerView= breakpoints (1/2/3/4).
 - Provide =.single-blog-card= markup with image, badge (absolute top-left), title, meta list.
 - Override Swiper nav colors to #134529 and use brand bullet for pagination.

*** Data Table (Directory)
 - Include =table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-checkable order-column= classes.
 - Wrap in responsive div (=overflow-x: auto=).
 - Use DataTables plugin with =#example4= ID for pagination/search.
 - Constrain long cells with =max-width= + ellipsis.

*** Contact Section
 - Split layout: form (8 cols) plus contact cards (4 cols).
 - Use =.default-btn= with arrow icon; checkbox baseline for GDPR acknowledgement.
 - Map: embed Google Maps iframe with container-level padding.

*** Footer & Copyright
 - Footer background #ffc107 with 100px top padding; includes About, Academics, Quick Links, Contact.
 - Icons via Flaticon; social links displayed inline.
 - Copyright bar #134529; list of portals aligned right; replicate “Rising Phoenix Corner” copy centered.
 - Back-to-top button fixed bottom-right (#134529).

** Interactivity & Motion
*** Libraries
 - Bootstrap 5 bundle (via CDN) for components/offcanvas.
 - Swiper 11 for sliders; configure autoplay 3s, loop true.
 - scrollCue for subtle scroll-in animations (=data-cues="slideInUp"=).
 - DataTables, Flatpickr, Summernote for admin/data-rich pages.
 - Feather icons, Font Awesome, RemixIcon for iconography.

*** Behaviors
 - Dropdown toggles rely on =data-bs-toggle="offcanvas"= or nested dropdown toggles; ensure =href="javascript:void(0)"= when no real link.
 - Countdown timer uses =setInterval=; clamp at zero.
 - Back-to-top button toggles based on scroll (handled in =app.js=).

** Forms & Inputs
 - Use Bootstrap form controls with border radius 4px, 14px padding.
 - Validate at HTML level (required attributes) and show errors in-line below inputs.
 - Contact form CTA uses =.default-btn border-0= with right-arrow icon.
 - For DataTables download link, pair anchor with =download= attribute for XLSX.

** Accessibility
 - Maintain contrast ratio > 4.5:1 (white text on #134529 or #cc0000, black text on #ffc107 for headings only—pair with bold weight).
 - All links require =text-decoration= on hover; top bar links stay underlined.
 - Provide =aria-label= for carousel controls, dropdown toggles, and back-to-top button.
 - Use semantic headings order; avoid skipping levels inside cards.

** Responsive Rules
 The smartphone portrait experience (≤576 px) is the baseline. Design, test, and QA every component on touch devices with limited bandwidth before scaling up.
 - Breakpoints:
   - ≤768px: reduce carousel height to 50vh, shrink captions (18px/14px).
   - ≤576px: stack header ribbon items, convert nav into off-canvas menu, set Swiper =slidesPerView=1.
 - Ensure dropdown menus become accordion lists inside responsive navbar (toggle classes replicated via =responsive-menu-list=).

** Utilities & Helpers
 - =.burger-menu= spans (top/middle/bottom) animate for navbar toggler.
 - =.badges= (news cards) vs Bootstrap =.badge=: use custom absolute placement (top:10px, left:10px).
 - =.pdf-container= for responsive document embeds.
 - Shadow/hover: cards translate Y -5px on hover; transitions 0.3s ease.

** Implementation Checklist
 1. Load critical CSS only (Bootstrap + site stylesheet + icon font) in =<head>=; lazy-load Swiper/scrollCue styles with =media="print" onload= when not immediately required.
 2. Concatenate essential JS into one deferred bundle (Bootstrap + site scripts). Dynamically import Swiper, counters, or scrollCue only on pages that instantiate them. Retire legacy scripts (hide.js/app.js/layout.js/theme-color.js/drop.js/caro.js) unless refactored into the new bundle.
 3. Register optional plugins (Flatpickr, Summernote, DataTables) per page via dynamic import to keep baseline payload minimal for low-connectivity users.
 4. When adding a new section, match padding, background, and heading treatments from existing sections before introducing new variations.
 5. Test both the desktop mega-nav and the off-canvas nav for parity.
